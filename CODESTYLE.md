# Code Style Guide

- Inline functions when they are used only once. (**if** it's possible)
- Keep your code simple: don't try to preview every use-case for your code, only the ones that really matters.
- Keep your code modular: it allows for more powerful modding abilities.
- Keep your code consistant: the variables and functions naming shouldn't be inconsistant. Please format your files when you're done working.
